With this post, I celebrate the inauguration of my professional blog where I hope to share my experience and insights applying GitHub to product development and operations.

Huge thanks to my colleague [Natalie Somersall](https://github.com/some-natalie/) for sharing how she uses GitHub Pages to host [her professional site](https://some-natalie.dev/)!
