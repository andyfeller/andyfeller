# Nice to meet you! :wave:

**About me**

<details>
  <summary>What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?</summary>

  * I have worked across many industries _(higher education, marketing, security, telecom)_ in various stages of growth as software developer, site reliability engineer, platform engineer, and even a LAN administrator.
  * I absolutely :heart_eyes_cat: cats and have a probably embarrasing number of cat t-shirts!
  * I :cook: a lot in a wide variety of styles, however :thumbsdown: on :fish: :shrimp: :crab: :lobster: :squid: :oyster: and most :cheese: _(mild white cheeses :ok_hand:)_
  * I grew up around greater Baton Rouge area in Louisiana, eventually went to [Louisiana State University](https://lsu.edu/), and marched as part of [The Golden Band from TigerLand](https://www.lsu.edu/cmda/bands/athletic/index.php) playing trombone.
  * I have been playing [Final Fantasy 14 MMORPG](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/) off and on for 8 years and always love [having others join me](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/friend_recruit/)!
  * I am a connoisseur of :beer:, :hamburger:, :coffee:, :cocktail:, role playing games, card games, board games, and cajun/creole food; love to talk about any of them!

<details>
  <summary>What drives you nuts?</summary>

  * Disorder, conflict, confusion, and ambiguity
  * Coordination and communication without visuals, documentation, roadmaps, agendas, and/or setting expectations
  * Inconsistency without exception and reasoning
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are your quirks?</summary>

  * I tend to step in and potentially overstep when I perceive disorder, conflict, confusion, or ambiguity; please believe this comes from a good place.
  * I am a very visual person :framed_picture: and might need to sketch or diagram problems to understand them better.
  * I might jokingly :laughing: say I hate all programming languages or tools as a way of staying detached; they **all** have strengths, weaknesses, and idiosyncrasies.
  * I believe writing documentation or communications takes as much thought and effort as writing code; sometimes it takes time
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?</summary>

  * Sometimes my :thinking: face gets confused with my :angry: or :rage: face; being a :bald_man: makes facial features more distinct but :bow: for patience
</details>

**About my colleagues**

<details>
  <summary>What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?</summary>

  * Proactive in communication and taking action
  * Prepared for events and discussions
  * Celebrate successes, achievements, and good fortunes of others
  * Genuine and introspective about who they are, where they come from, and what truly matters most to them
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?</summary>

  * High-level planning and coordination efforts without data and/or roadmaps
  * Asking for help without relevant information provided upfront
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can people earn an extra gold star with you?</summary>

  * Be genuine celebrating others!
  * Be persistent in seeing a question answered or a problem solved!
  * Present short and long term solutions upfront; a majority of hard problems need both and this is often a cause of talking past one another!
  * Take and own responsibility actively!
</details>

**About my interactions**

<details>
  <summary>How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?</summary>

  * Celebrate others' efforts in channels / venues where their leaders can see and recognize it _(Slack, formal accolade processes, etc)_
  * Get to know colleagues _(backgrounds, experiences, values, and aspirations)_ and include them in discussions and activities around them
  * Partner together on activities, training one another up in a safe space
  * Spend 1:1 time asking for feedback
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What’s the best way to communicate with you?</summary>

  * Visuals are better than documentation, both are better than verbal knowledge sharing
  * Provide context, agendas, and any expectations prior to meetings so I can actively participate
  * Tell me how much time you need, so I can block that off for you especially; I prefer to be present for discussions as a courtesy for you
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What’s the best way to convince you to do something?</summary>

  * Actively ask and engage me, give me space to ask questions
  * Demonstrate it is something everyone on the team and/or organization is doing
  * Affirm this is what will make me successful and celebrated
  * If there isn't data for this, then explicitly ask me for trust; this works especially when reciprocated if I need to ask for trust, too
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you like to give feedback?</summary>

  * For feedback that might be potentially sensitive; personal; or emotional, I will ask for 1:1 time on video and might follow up with additional context after the conversation
  * I prefer giving feedback around the results of work and other external things as I try to disassociate people from the work done
  * I try to ask lots of questions because I really do want to understand; sometimes it’s a lot because situations are complex
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do you like to get feedback?</summary>

  * Help me feel like we collectively have something to improve and that we are in it together
  * Help me feel heard and understood even if you can't sympathize or empathize
  * Please reinforce the good things as much as improving others
</details>
