This workshop was created for [Git Merge 2022](https://git-merge.com/) to showcase [Git support for signing and verifying commits with SSH keys](https://github.blog/2021-11-15-highlights-from-git-2-34/) along with [GitHub support](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-verification).  This is the 3rd method including GPG key and X509 certificates for signing Git content.
